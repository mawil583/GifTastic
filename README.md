# GifTastic

This is a gif button generator. Click on a provided button to display gifs or create your own button by submitting something to the textbox. If you want to animate the gif, click on the gif once. If you want to stop it, click it agian. 

This project used jQuery for DOM manipulation and event handling. Styling was accomplished via Bootstrap and custom CSS to override some Bootstrap classes. I used the Giphy API using an AJAX GET request.
